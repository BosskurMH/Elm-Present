# Elm-Present

Presentations in Elm (0.19) with Markdown slides, animated, interruptible transitions etc. You should be able to do just:

```
npm i
```

Then to start

```
npm start
```

on Windows maybe try:

```
npm run start-windows
```

Not really sure if it will work but probably path needs to be fixed

## Suggested next steps

- [ ] Themes (day/night mode?)
- [ ] Add stack (vertical slides)
- [ ] More shorcuts (skip forward by \_)
- [ ] Interative things(?)

## Changes

19/2/2019 try to make it work on Windows, remove unnecessary install step (as elm-live takes care of it)
14/2/2019 clean up
13/2/2019 Initial frustrating port from 0.18 to 0.19
